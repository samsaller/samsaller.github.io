# Threejs-template
Three.js starting template

---
## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npx vite` to start the development server
4. Ctrl+Click on the link in terminal

---
## Project Structure
Basic orbit controls

Default cube with normal material

Commented code for enabling double click full screen

---
## Building
1. Run `npx vite build` to build
2. Use `--outDir` to set output directory

Example: `npx vite build --outDir docs`

I use "docs" to use these files in the GitHub Pages.

I also recommend to change the links in index.html to point to the correct location of the files from absolute to relative.

Example: `<script type="module" crossorigin src="/assets/index-ItU2MGZi.js"></script>` 

to `<script type="module" crossorigin src="./assets/index-ItU2MGZi.js"></script>`
